We want to manually mark several minutes

use background subtraction to remove background
use k-means with hand-selected means to identify umbrella's centroids.
propagate measure forward 1 frame, and reuse k-means to distribute -- does this work?

Automatically Identify colors for the entire 2 minute convergence run.
use k-means to move centroids to track umbrellas (the tracking problem is relatively easy -- and if the 'centroid' ever ends not in an umbrella, we can ask the user for help.

If we encounter negative results for the formation of dMEC hexagonal patterns with the manipulation of forward-translation we can mount and fix the arena on a vertical motion simulator (Figure 5B).  Dora Angelaki has such a simulator (Figure 5D) used for visual-vestibular monkey setup and similar to a Steward Platform (Steward, 1966).
We will then further test a set of ‘Flintstone’ car experiments under small vertical motion, creating a slice of 3D movement.  Such movements are known to slightly change space topology (Kröller et al, 2009) while still maintaining directionality of movement and naturalistic speed. 



TODO:

I love the 101 kilobot robot picture (do you have a picture of their sensors too? I want to add it next to the r-one robots (see attached pic)... also could you write me something about dimensions and qualities for both types of robots? which one is smaller? faster transmission range? one particular sensor present in one but not the other?..
